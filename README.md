# Search Engine Crawler

This is the web crawler for my second attempt at a search engine. The purpose is to:

-   Extract keywords from provided web pages
-   Lemmatize the keywords into their raw form
-   Create an efficient index inside the database for each keyword and website, prepared for the proximity and TF-IDF calculations done at query time

This runs in conjunction with the other two repositories:
- [API](https://github.com/conaticus/search-engine-api)
- [Client Side](https://github.com/conaticus/search-engine-client)
